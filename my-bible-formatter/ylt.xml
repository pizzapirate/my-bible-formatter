				All the generations, therefore, from Abraham unto David <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">are</STYLE> fourteen generations, and from David unto the Babylonian removal fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian removal unto the Christ, fourteen generations.
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And of Jesus Christ, the birth was thus: For his mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph, before their coming together she was found to have conceived from the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and Joseph her husband being righteous, and not willing to make her an example, did wish privately to send her away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">
				And on his thinking of these things, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream appeared to him, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, you may not fear to receive Mary your wife, for that which in her was conceived <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">is</STYLE> of the Holy Spirit,
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And all this has come to pass, that it may be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">
				'Lo, the virgin shall conceive, and she shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,' which is, being interpreted 'With us <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">he is</STYLE> God.'
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And Joseph, having risen from the sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord directed him, and received his wife,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and did not know her till she brought forth her son -- the first-born, and he called his name Jesus.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">And Jesus having been born in Beth-Lehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, lo, mages from the east came to Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">saying, 'Where is he who was born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and we came to bow to him.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And Herod the king having heard, was stirred, and all Jerusalem with him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he was inquiring from them where the Christ is born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And they said to him, 'In Beth-Lehem of Judea, for thus it has been written through the prophet,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And you, Beth-Lehem, the land of Judah, you are by no means the least among the leaders of Judah, for out of you shall come one leading, who shall feed My people Israel.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod, privately having called the mages, did inquire exactly from them the time of the appearing star,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and having sent them to Beth-Lehem, he said, 'Having gone -- inquire you exactly for the child, and whenever you may have found, bring me back word, that I also having come may bow to him.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And they, having heard the king, departed, and lo, the star, that they did see in the east, did go before them, till, having come, it stood over where the child was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And having seen the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and having come to the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and having fallen down they bowed to him, and having opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and having been divinely warned in a dream not to turn back unto Herod, through another way they withdrew to their own region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And on their having withdrawn, lo, a messenger of the Lord does appear in a dream to Joseph, saying, 'Having risen, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and be you there till I may speak to you, for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And he, having risen, took the child and his mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and he was there till the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 'Out of Egypt I did call My Son.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then Herod, having seen that he was deceived by the mages, was very enraged, and having sent forth, he murdered all the male children in Beth-Lehem, and in all its borders, from two years and under, according to the time that he inquired exactly from the mages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">
				'A voice in Ramah was heard -- lamentation and weeping and much mourning -- Rachel weeping <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">for</STYLE> her children, and she would not be comforted because they are not.'
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And Herod having died, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream does appear to Joseph in Egypt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">saying, 'Having risen, take the child and his mother, and be going to the land of Israel, for they have died -- those seeking the life of the child.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And he, having risen, took the child and his mother, and came to the land of Israel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and having heard that Archelaus does reign over Judea instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go there, and having been divinely warned in a dream, he withdrew to the parts of Galilee,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and coming, he dwelt in a city named Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophets, that 'A Nazarene he shall be called.'</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">And in those days comes John the Baptist, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and saying, 'Reform, for come near has the reign of the heavens,'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">for this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, 'A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, straight make you His paths.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And this John had his clothing of camel's hair, and a girdle of skin round his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and honey of the field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then were going forth unto him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing their sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming about his baptism, he said to them, 'Brood of vipers! Who did show you to flee from the coming wrath?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Bear, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and do not think to say in yourselves, A father we have -- Abraham, for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and now also, the axe unto the root of the trees is laid, every tree therefore not bearing good fruit is hewn down, and to fire is cast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">'I indeed do baptize you with water to reformation, but he who after me is coming is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to bear the sandals, he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">
				whose fan <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">is</STYLE> in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather his wheat to the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.'
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then comes Jesus from Galilee upon the Jordan, unto John to be baptized by him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">but John was forbidding him, saying, 'I have need by you to be baptized -- and you do come unto me!'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">
				But Jesus answering said to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'Permit now, for thus it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness,'</STYLE> then he does permit him.
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and lo, opened to him were the heavens, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, 'This is My Son -- the Beloved, in whom I did delight.'</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus was led up to the wilderness by the Spirit, to be tempted by the Devil,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he did hunger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And the Tempter having come to him said, 'If Son you are of God -- speak that these stones may become loaves.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">
				But he answering said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'It has been written, Not upon bread alone does man live, but upon every word coming forth from the mouth of God.'</STYLE>
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">
				Then does the Devil take him to the <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">holy</STYLE> city, and does set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and said to him, 'If Son you are of God -- cast yourself down, for it has been written, that, His messengers He shall charge concerning you, and on hands they shall bear you up, that you may not dash on a stone your foot.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">
				Jesus said to him again, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'It has been written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'</STYLE>
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Again does the Devil take him to a very high mount, and does show to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and said to him, 'All these to you I will give, if falling down you may bow to me.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">
				Then said Jesus to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'Go -- Adversary, for it has been written, The Lord your God you shall bow to, and Him only you shall serve.'</STYLE>
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then does the Devil leave him, and lo, messengers came and were ministering to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up, did withdraw to Galilee,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and having left Nazareth, having come, he dwelt at Capernaum that is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtalim,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">'Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations! --</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The people that is sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death -- light arose to them.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">
				From that time began Jesus to proclaim and to say, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'Reform you, for come near has the reign of the heavens.'</STYLE>
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon named Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea -- for they were fishers --</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">
				and he said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'Come you after me, and I will make you fishers of men,'</STYLE>
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and they, immediately, having left the nets, did follow him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And having advanced from there, he saw other two brothers, James of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, refitting their nets, and he called them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and they, immediately, having left the boat and their father, did follow him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And Jesus was going about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the reign, and healing every disease, and every malady among the people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and his fame went forth to all Syria, and they brought to him all having ailments, pressed with manifold sicknesses and pains, and demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And there followed him many multitudes from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">And having seen the multitudes, he went up to the mount, and he having sat down, his disciples came to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and having opened his mouth, he was teaching them, saying:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="24">And Pilate having seen that it profits nothing, but rather a tumult is made, having taken water, he did wash the hands before the multitude, saying, 'I am innocent from the blood of this righteous one; you -- you shall see;'</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">opening and alleging, 'That the Christ it behoved to suffer, and to rise again out of the dead, and that this is the Christ -- Jesus whom I proclaim to you.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And certain of them did believe, and attached themselves to Paul and to Silas, also of the worshipping Greeks a great multitude, of the principal women also not a few.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">
				And the unbelieving Jews, having been moved with envy, and having taken to them of the loungers certain evil men, and having made a crowd, were setting the city in an uproar; having assailed also the house of Jason, they were seeking them to bring <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">them</STYLE> to the populace,

			<VERS vnumber="13">And when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that also in Berea was the word of God declared by Paul, they came thither also, agitating the multitudes;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">And certain of the Epicurean and of the Stoic philosophers, were meeting together to see him, and some were saying, 'What would this seed picker wish to say?' and others, 'Of strange demons he does seem to be an announcer;' because Jesus and the rising again he did proclaim to them as good news,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="26">He made also of one blood every nation of men, to dwell upon all the face of the earth -- having ordained times before appointed, and the bounds of their dwellings --</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="29">'Being, therefore, offspring of God, we ought not to think the Godhead to be like to gold, or silver, or stone, graving of art and device of man;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">the times, indeed, therefore, of the ignorance God having overlooked, does now command all men everywhere to reform,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="32">And having heard of a rising again of the dead, some, indeed, were mocking, but others said, 'We will hear you again concerning this;'</VERS>

				and he having come unto us, and having taken up the girdle of Paul, having bound also his own hands and feet, said, 'Thus said the Holy Spirit, The man whose is this girdle -- so shall the Jews in Jerusalem bind, and they shall deliver <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">him</STYLE> up to the hands of nations.'

				and a great dissension having come, the chief captain having been afraid lest Paul may be pulled to pieces by them, commanded the soldiery, having gone down, to take him by force out of the midst of them, and to bring <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">him</STYLE> to the castle.

				Because of this it benefits <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">us</STYLE> more abundantly to take heed to the things heard, lest we may glide aside,
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">for if the word being spoken through messengers did become stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience did receive a just recompense,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">how shall we escape, having neglected so great salvation? which a beginning receiving -- to be spoken through the Lord -- by those having heard was confirmed to us,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">God also bearing joint-witness both with signs and wonders, and manifold powers, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to His will.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For not to messengers did He subject the coming world, concerning which we speak,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and one in a certain place did testify fully, saying, 'What is man, that You are mindful of him, or a son of man, that You do look after him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You did make him some little less than messengers, with glory and honour You did crown him, and did set him over the works of Your hands,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">all things You did put in subjection under his feet,' for in the subjecting to him the all things, nothing did He leave to him unsubjected, and now not yet do we see the all things subjected to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and him who was made some little less than messengers we see -- Jesus -- because of the suffering of the death, with glory and honour having been crowned, that by the grace of God for every one he might taste of death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">
				For it was becoming to Him, because of whom <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">are</STYLE> the all things, and through whom <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">are</STYLE> the all things, many sons to glory bringing, the author of their salvation through sufferings to make perfect,
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">
				for both he who is sanctifying and those sanctified <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">are</STYLE> all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">saying, 'I will declare Your name to my brethren, in the midst of an assembly I will sing praise to You;' and again, 'I will be trusting on Him;'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and again, 'Behold I and the children that God did give to me.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Seeing, then, the children have partaken of flesh and blood, he himself also in like manner did take part of the same, that through death he might destroy him having the power of death -- that is, the devil --</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and might deliver those, whoever, with fear of death, throughout all their life, were subjects of bondage,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">for, doubtless, of messengers it does not lay hold, but of seed of Abraham it lays hold,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">therefore it did behoove him in all things to be made like to the brethren, that he might become a kind and stedfast chief-priest in the things with God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">for in that he suffered, himself being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in all his house,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">for of more glory than Moses has this one been counted worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house has he who does build it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">
				for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all things did build <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">is</STYLE> God,
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">
				and Moses indeed <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">was</STYLE> stedfast in all his house, as an attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be spoken,
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and Christ, as a Son over his house, whose house are we, if the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we hold fast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, (as the Holy Spirit says, 'To-day, if His voice you may hear --</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">you may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and saw My works forty years;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">therefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, Always do they go astray in heart, and these have not known My ways;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- !')</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">but exhort you one another every day, while the To-day is called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of the sin,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">for partakers we have become of the Christ, if the beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">in its being said, 'To-day, if His voice you may hear, you may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did come out of Egypt through Moses;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest, except to those who did not believe? --</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">for we do enter into the rest -- we who did believe, as He said, 'So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- ;' and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">
				for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">day</STYLE> thus: 'And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;'
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">
				and in this <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">place</STYLE> again, 'If they shall enter into My rest -- ;'
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">since then, it remains for certain to enter into it, and those who did first hear good news entered not in because of unbelief --</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">again He does limit a certain day, 'To-day,' (in David saying, after so long a time,) as it has been said, 'To-day, if His voice you may hear, you may not harden your hearts,'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning another day have spoken after these things;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">there does remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his works, as God from His own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow, and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">
				and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him, but all things <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">are</STYLE> naked and open to His eyes -- with whom is our reckoning.
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the heavens -- Jesus the Son of God -- may we hold fast the profession,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">
				for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathize with our infirmities, but <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">one</STYLE> tempted in all things in like manner -- apart from sin;
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace -- for seasonable help.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">
				For every chief priest -- out of men taken -- in behalf of men is set in things <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">pertaining</STYLE> to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,

			<VERS vnumber="2">able to be gentle to those ignorant and going astray, since himself also is compassed with infirmity;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and because of this infirmity he ought, as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and no one to himself does take the honour, but he who is called by God, as also Aaron:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief priest, but He who spake unto him: 'My Son you are, I to-day have begotten you;'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">
				as also in another <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">place</STYLE> He says, 'You <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">are</STYLE> a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;'

			<VERS vnumber="7">who in the days of his flesh both prayers and supplications unto Him who was able to save him from death -- with strong crying and tears -- having offered up, and having been heard in respect to that which he feared,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">through being a Son, did learn by the things which he suffered -- the obedience,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and having been made perfect, he did become to all those obeying him a cause of salvation age-during,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">having been addressed by God a chief priest, according to the order of Melchisedek,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">concerning whom we have much discourse and of hard explanation to say, since you have become dull of hearing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">
				for even owing to be teachers, because of the time, again you have need that one teach you what <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">are</STYLE> the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and you have become having need of milk, and not of strong food,

			<VERS vnumber="13">
				for every one who is partaking of milk <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">is</STYLE> unskilled in the word of righteousness -- for he is an infant,

		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, having left the word of the beginning of the Christ, unto the perfection we may advance, not again a foundation laying of reformation from dead works, and of faith on God,</VERS>

		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of the kings, and did bless him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first, indeed, being interpreted, 'King of righteousness,' and then also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like to the Son of God, does remain a priest continually.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">
				And see how great this one <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">is</STYLE>, to whom also a tenth Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils,
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though they came forth out of the loins of Abraham;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he has blessed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is blessed --</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">
				and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">he</STYLE>, who is testified to that he was living,

			<VERS vnumber="9">and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes, has paid tithes,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood -- for the people under it had received law -- what further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the law a change does come,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">for he of whom these things are said in another tribe has had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">
				for <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">it is</STYLE> evident that out of Judah has arisen our Lord, in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
			</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there does arise another priest,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">

				And inasmuch as <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">it is</STYLE> not apart from oath, (for those indeed apart from oath are become priests,

			<VERS vnumber="25">whence also he is able to save to the very end, those coming through him unto God -- ever living to make intercession for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">For such a chief priest did become us -- kind, harmless, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">who has no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">
				for the law does appoint men chief priests, having infirmity, but the word of the oath that <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">is</STYLE> after the law <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">appoints</STYLE> the Son -- to the age having been perfected.

			<VERS vnumber="2">of the holy places a servant, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord did set up, and not man,</VERS>
